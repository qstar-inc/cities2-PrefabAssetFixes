	<LongDescription>
This mod makes simple fixes that prevents some assets from functioning or just to make it look good.

## Current Fixes:
### Vanilla
* Prison: Change the vehicle count to 20 so that all the service parkings are used.
* Prison Van: Changed the vehicle size to Large, which allows the vans to be parked/spawned from all prison facilites (vanilla or custom).

Assets placed before the changes made from this mod will not have the changes applied as it requires replopping.

If you have more suggestion of fixes to be added, be sure to find me and inform me.
