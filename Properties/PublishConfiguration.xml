	<LongDescription>
This mod makes simple fixes that prevents some assets from functioning or just to make it look good.

## Current Fixes:
### Vanilla
* Prison: Change the vehicle count to 20 so that all the service parkings are used.
* Prison Van: Changed the vehicle size to Large, which allows the vans to be parked/spawned from all prison facilites (vanilla or custom).
* Storage and Recycling Center: Fix Storage Section not being shown for service buildings. And fix any Recycling buildings not being able to sell their products (vanilla or custom).
* Hospital: Change the service vehicle parking count from 10 to 30.

Assets placed before the changes made from this mod will not have the changes applied as it requires replopping.

If you have more suggestion of fixes to be added, be sure to find me and inform me.
